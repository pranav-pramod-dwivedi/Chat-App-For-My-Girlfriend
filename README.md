# Chat-App-For-My-Girlfriend 💬

🖤 A Note (Optional Read)
Hey stranger,
if you have some time, read this.
It’s been a year since she ghosted me. Everything was going good — I got attached, and slowly she became a routine instead of just my girlfriend. Maybe that’s where things changed.
I don’t want any of my family members to read or know about this, because it may make things worse. If you’re here, just treat this as a quiet corner of the internet.
You can use my Firebase if you want — I don’t mind.
Good luck....💗
